🚀 Overview

The ARC Raiders FPS Targeting Framework explores how advanced targeting and aiming logic can be structured in a clean, extensible, and performance-oriented way for FPS games.

The project emphasizes configuration-driven design, modular components, and scalability across different gameplay scenarios, including bot behavior simulation, weapon tuning experiments, and input response modeling.

Built for experimentation, analysis, and conceptual study in FPS systems.

⚙️ Key Concepts

Target Acquisition Models
Abstract algorithms for selecting and prioritizing targets in first-person perspectives.

Motion Prediction Pipelines
Conceptual trajectory estimation models designed for high-speed FPS combat scenarios.

Input Smoothing & Response Curves
Research-oriented approaches to create natural and consistent aiming behavior.

Weapon Profile Abstraction
Parameter-driven profiles allowing different tuning strategies for rifles, SMGs, shotguns, and sniper rifles.

Performance-Aware Design
Emphasis on low overhead, predictable execution, and modular separation of concerns.

🧩 Project Structure

The repository is organized to reflect a real-world FPS system layout:

core/ — foundational system interfaces

modules/ — isolated feature components

configs/ — configuration schemas and examples

docs/ — architectural notes and design explanations

assets/ — auxiliary resources (images, diagrams)

⚠️ Focuses on structure and design clarity, not on shipping a functional product.

📌 Use Cases

FPS gameplay system research

Weapon tuning & targeting simulations

Bot/AI aiming experimentation

Configuration-driven system design studies

Educational reference for FPS system architecture

📖 Documentation

Detailed documentation is provided to outline system intentions, data flow, and configuration philosophy.
This project is intended to be read, explored, and extended, rather than used as a drop-in FPS mod.

⚠️ Disclaimer

This repository:

does not interact with live games or online services

does not provide ready-to-use gameplay modifications

is intended solely for educational, research, and demonstrational purposes

📬 Contribution

Contributions, discussions, and conceptual improvements are welcome.
Feel free to fork, explore, or adapt the structure for your own FPS system experiments.
