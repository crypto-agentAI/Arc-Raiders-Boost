🚀 Overview

The ARC Raiders Targeting Systems Framework explores how advanced targeting logic can be structured in a clean, extensible, and performance-oriented way.
The project emphasizes configuration-driven design, modular components, and scalability across different gameplay scenarios.

Built with flexibility and experimentation in mind.

⚙️ Key Concepts

Target Acquisition Models
Abstract logic for selecting and prioritizing targets based on spatial and contextual data.

Motion Prediction Pipelines
Conceptual trajectory estimation models designed for fast-paced combat environments.

Input Smoothing & Response Curves
Research-oriented approaches to creating natural and consistent control behavior.

Weapon Profile Abstraction
Parameter-driven profiles allowing different tuning strategies per weapon class.

Performance-Aware Design
Emphasis on low overhead, predictable execution, and clean separation of concerns.

🧩 Project Structure

The repository is organized to reflect a real-world system layout:

core/ — foundational system interfaces

modules/ — isolated feature components

configs/ — configuration schemas and examples

docs/ — architectural notes and design explanations

assets/ — auxiliary resources

Note: this project focuses on structure and design clarity, not on shipping a finished product.

📌 Use Cases

Technical prototyping

Gameplay system research

Targeting logic experimentation

Configuration-driven system design studies

Educational reference for modular architectures

📖 Documentation

Detailed documentation is provided to outline system intentions, data flow, and configuration philosophy.
The project is intended to be read, explored, and extended, rather than used as a drop-in solution.

⚠️ Disclaimer

This repository does not interact with live games, protected processes, or online services.
It does not provide ready-to-use gameplay modifications.
All materials are for educational, experimental, and demonstrational purposes only.
